/**
 * The reviewer's Phase-1 live follow-ups, measured rather than eyeballed.
 *
 * Two classes of leftover were found on the live NBA modal:
 *
 *  1. **A bare heading with nothing under it.** `FixtureFlow`'s pre-game row is
 *     the fixture's own name and nothing else, so before tip-off it rendered an
 *     `MIA vs TOR` heading with no sentence beneath it. Measured across the
 *     three states, not assumed: the pre-game flow carries ONE row and it is
 *     that heading; the finished flow carries two real sentences (the result and
 *     the pick's rightness) that must survive. So the fix is not a blanket
 *     deletion — it is a heading that is conditional on rows existing beneath
 *     it, which is asserted here rather than checked by looking.
 *
 *  2. **The legacy header strip repeated the block's figures.** It read
 *     `53% MIA to win | MIA by 4.8 | 230.6` ABOVE the instant block, so the
 *     moneyline probability was on the page three times. The block owns the
 *     figures, so the header's copies go — but only the ones the block actually
 *     draws, and the field-by-field audit below is what decides which.
 *
 * The audit, measured on a rendered modal (see each test's comment):
 *   - pick probability   — the block draws it in the `moneyline` tile AND on the
 *                          bar, so the header's copy is a THIRD. Removed.
 *   - projected margin   — the block draws NO spread tile (the game carries no
 *                          market line), so the header's is the ONLY copy. Kept.
 *   - projected total    — same: no total tile, because no total line. Kept.
 * So the strip keeps its two unique figures and loses only the duplicated one.
