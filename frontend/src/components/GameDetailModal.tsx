    /* THE BARE HEADING, and why the sides are spelled two ways here.
       Measured across the three states rather than assumed:
         - pre-game  — the flow's ONLY row was the fixture's own name, so the
                       live modal showed an `MIA vs TOR` heading with nothing
                       under it, directly above the AI button.
         - finished  — two REAL sentences (the result, and the pick's
                       rightness). These are live content and they stay.
       So this is not a deletion of the flow; it is the heading being
       conditional on rows existing beneath it, expressed in the only place a
       site may express it -- the bundle it hands over.

       `FixtureFlow` reads the sides under `home_team`/`away_team` for BOTH its
       pre-game name row AND its finished result sentence, so one spelling
       cannot suppress the first without breaking the second. `bundleFacts`
       (which is what the block's verdict sentence goes through) reads
       `home_team ?? team_home`, and both spellings are part of that package's
       documented contract -- its own header names PL's `team_home` and Sports'
       `home_team` as the two shapes it exists to bridge. So:

         - ALWAYS carry `team_home`/`team_away`, which the block's
           `fullTeamName` reads to expand "TOR" into "Raptors is the pick."
           Without this the block would fall back to the bare code.
         - carry `home_team`/`away_team` ONLY when the flow has a sentence that
           needs them -- i.e. once there is a score or a result. Pre-game there
           is no such sentence, and withholding the spelling the name row reads
           is what leaves the flow empty instead of bare.

       The block's figures do not depend on either key: `panelFacts` is handed
       this site's own game object, not the bundle, so the tile and the bar are
       unchanged by which spelling is present. */
    // The one condition the pre-game name row keys on, and nothing else: only
    // `home_team`/`away_team` make it exist, and only `in-play`/`finished` rows

               times: here, in the block's `moneyline` tile, and on the bar. Per
               the one-source rule the block owns the figures, so that cell is
               GONE -- the block's tile states the probability and which side it
               is, which is what this cell was saying in two pieces.

               The other two WERE KEPT when the game carried no market line and
               the "Other model markets" block had no cover probabilities. Now
               that block draws them with ± and σ, so this legacy strip is
               hidden when cover probabilities are available -- it only renders
               as a fallback for games with no market line and no cover probs.
               Finished games never render it (the Final block owns that state). */

            Sports' `GameDetailModal` and PL's `FixtureModal` put them, so a fixture
            page reads the same way in all three.

            On NBA this is the only place the out player's own projection appears at
            all: `/games/{id}/players` withholds his rows before serialising, so the
            mention under the lists below is all he gets today. This row is the first
            thing on the page that says what the model expected of him.

            **Gated on `drawnSignals`, NOT on `signals`.** `signals.length > 0` counts
            the RAW list, and `SignalRows` drops any row it cannot draw and returns
            `null` when none survive -- so the raw guard mounted a `<section>` with no
            heading and no rows inside it, which is the empty state spec §2 forbids
            ("no data, no row"). The filter is exported by the shared component
            precisely so a caller can gate on the same answer the renderer computes,
            rather than re-deriving it and getting it subtly wrong. Caught by
            CodeRabbit on #36.

            **The heading exists because `aria-labelledby` names it.** The first
            version carried `aria-labelledby={`${titleId}-signals`}` with no element
            of that id anywhere, so the reference dangled and the section was
            announced with no name at all -- worse than an unlabelled section, because
            it reads as labelled to anyone auditing the attribute. The sibling
