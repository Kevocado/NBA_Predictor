/**
 * NBA's game modal fetches and renders its `absence` row.
 *
 * `/api/signals/{game_id}` shipped in #33 and is **live in production** — but
 * nothing on this page asked for it, so the endpoint served rows to no reader. The
 * vendored `SignalRows` can draw `absence_strip`; this is the hop between them, and
 * it mirrors Sports' `GameDetailModal` and PL's `FixtureModal` so "a fixture page
 * shows its signals" stays one implementation across all three.
 *
 * ## Why this is worth more on NBA than on the other two
 *
 * NBA is the sport where the absence was *invisible*: `api/routes.get_game_players`
 * drops an out player's rows before serialising, and `OutPlayerOut` carries no
 * projection, no stat and no rank. So today the page shows the out player as a
 * one-line mention under the lists and **nothing else** — while every player he
 * outranks silently gains a place. This row is the first thing on the page that says
 * what he was expected to do.
 *
 * ## EVERY failure is silence, and the failures are indistinguishable
 *
 * A 404, a network error and an honest empty list all leave `[]`. Spec §2's "no data,
 * no row" forbids a placeholder, and a signal is an *enhancement* on this page: it
 * must never become the page's error state.
 *
 * ## The gate is `detail.completed`, not a truthiness test
 *
 * `/api/signals/{game_id}` answers `[]` for a game that has started, and the reason
 * is the same one that empties the props feed: a started game's roster is the one
 * known *before* tip-off, so quoting it afterwards is hindsight. Asking is skipped
 * outright, once per started game, rather than asking for an answer already known.
 *
 * **This heading used to say `detail.game_status`, and that was the bug.** This
 * API sends `completed: boolean` and has no `game_status` field at all, so the
 * docstring described a gate that never existed. The first version of the component
 * matched it, and the first version of this fixture set `game_status: "final"` too --
 * so the test and the component agreed on the same fiction and the suite was green
 * against a field the backend does not send. `tsc --noEmit` was what broke the tie,
 * because the property is not on the `GameDetail` type. Both are corrected here, and
 * the fixture below carries `completed` only.
