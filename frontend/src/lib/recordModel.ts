 * NBA's adapter: its `/hub/track-record` payload onto the shared `RecordModel`.
 * The kit renders the model, so no part of this wire shape reaches a kit
 * component.

 * NBA is the one sport whose headline is the PRE-TIP-OFF subset, so the model is
 * built with `headline: "preKickoff"` and the big number comes from `pre_tip`.
 * `counted` still carries the whole record, per the model's contract, even
 * though this page's headline does not lead with it.
