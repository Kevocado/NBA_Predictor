/**
 * The post-game review: which projections the model got right, which it got
 * wrong, and by how much.
 *
 * A projection is judged against a BAND, not against zero: the props model's
 * own holdout error for that stat (points 4.6, rebounds 1.9, assists 1.3,
 * threes 0.9 today). A player who misses by two points has not been beaten
 * by the model -- the model was two points wrong, which is what its error
 * estimate says it can be. The band moves with each retrain, because it is
 * read from the model rather than written down here.
 *
 * Three rules that are the whole of it:
 *
 * * **A gap exactly equal to the band is on the number.** The band is the
 *   model's own error, so a miss of exactly that size is the model being
 *   wrong as much as it said it would be. Counting it as a beating would
 *   make the review's verdict depend on a rounding.
 * * **A player who did not play is not judged.** A projection for someone
 *   who never got on the floor has nothing to be right or wrong about.
 * * **A projection rebuilt after tip-off is never judged.** It was made with
 *   the result already known, so beating it would be beating a copy of the
 *   answer.
