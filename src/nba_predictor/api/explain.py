"""Proxy for the plain-English explainer service.

NBA's FastAPI serves the site, so Caddy only ever reverse-proxies this app. The
browser therefore cannot reach the explainer directly: it calls
``/api/explain/{sport}/{id}`` here, and this route forwards to the service's
own ``/explain/{sport}/{id}``.

The proxy is deliberately thin and deliberately unforgiving. A summary is a
nice-to-have on top of a game page, so every upstream failure becomes one fixed
502 and the site's own error state takes it from there — the game detail never
depends on this route answering. No upstream body is ever returned: an
explainer error can carry key material or an internal path.
