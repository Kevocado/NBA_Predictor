"""availability.py -- lagged rotation-availability proxy (single chronological pass).

For game G and team T: of T's top-8 rotation players (ranked by cumulative minutes in
T's games BEFORE G), the share of that rotation's minutes / production (pts + 1.2 reb +
1.5 ast) held by players who did NOT play in T's PREVIOUS completed game. A player who
missed the last game is more likely to be out again; this is known before tip-off and
uses box scores only (no injury feed).

Causality: the value for G is recorded BEFORE G's own box score is folded into state, so
changing G's box score cannot move G's features.

Unplayed / upcoming games, and completed games with no player box score, are emitted from
state as it stands (T's last game that HAS a box score and the cumulative minutes so far)
and are never folded in. They are never NaN.

Default (documented): a team with no player-box history yet (its first game, or no player
boxes at all) gets 0.0 absent share on both columns, i.e. "nobody known to be missing".

Evidence: NBA#74 follow-up, held-out 2022-23..2024-25 confirmation (docs/nba-availability-evaluation).

    The plain function ranks the rotation by cumulative minutes over WHATEVER frame it is given. Production only ever
    feeds it about a season (the ingest window starts at the previous season's Oct 1), where that is fine. Over a longer
    frame it silently degrades: measured over 2018-2025 the mean absent-minutes share is 0.49, against 0.34 over the
    production window, because players who left years ago stay in the top 8 and can never have "played last game".
    So a longer training frame must not change what the feature means: each season's games are scored from the previous
    season's Oct 1 on, exactly what production sees. On a frame that already starts there this is identical to the plain
    function (pinned by a test), so nothing changes today.
