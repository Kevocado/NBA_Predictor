"""The prop models' feature frame.

His own rolling means (features/player_stats.py) plus what chronological-holdout evidence says is worth having
(nba-eval/props_race2.py, 2021-2025, games played, paired bootstrap vs "his rolling mean"): minutes (last game, a
5-game EWMA, the trend), the matchup block already in features/prop_matchup.py (opponent defence against his position,
rest, usage trend) and home/away. With all of them the model beats the rolling mean in points (4.737 -> 4.661, interval
[-0.082,-0.068]), rebounds (-0.026) and assists (-0.013), and ties on threes; the five rolling means alone only tie it.

Everything is shift(1)-based, so an upcoming row (no stats yet) is built from history only. XGBoost reads NaN as
"missing", so a first game or an unmapped position is left NaN rather than invented.
