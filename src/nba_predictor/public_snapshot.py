"""Refuse to publish a snapshot built on stale models (spec section 10, gap G6).

The snapshot carried whatever manifest it was handed. On 2026-10-04 it happily
published a snapshot stamped fresh while serving models trained on 2026-09-18 --
the reader sees "generated today" and reasonably concludes the numbers behind it
are current. They were not, and nothing on the page said so.

The fix is the NFL pattern (`public_snapshot.py` L226-272): compare the model's
`trained_at` against now at publish time and refuse when it is too old.

`MAX_MODEL_AGE_DAYS` is a **named constant because Kevin decides it**. It is not
tuned so a particular model passes; `tests/test_snapshot_staleness.py` pins the
Phase A measurement against it so loosening it fails a test rather than quietly
reversing a conclusion.

A refusal raises rather than warns. The alternative is a snapshot with a
staleness banner on it, which is one more thing a reader has to notice, and the
whole point is that they would not.
