"""Player props: the COUNTED pick per player+stat, and the resolved MAE.

The MAE is computed from RESOLVED rows only -- rows with both a prediction and
a recorded actual. It grades the same pick the track record counts: the
EARLIEST recorded one for that (game, player, stat), whenever it was made
(`track-record-counts-every-pick`, predictor-hub #66, 2026-10-01). A backtest
row -- a prediction written after the game was played and scored against that
game's result -- is a recorded pick, so it counts, and it is labelled
`made_before_tip: False` rather than dropped.

Before that decision this module graded "the newest row made before tip-off,
else the newest, flagged rebuilt" and skipped the rebuilt ones outright. The
docstring here used to argue for that exclusion by appealing to CFB's track
record. It no longer does, because CFB's track record reversed too (CFB #27):
the exclusion was not accuracy, it was a record that stopped tracking.

**What did not change, deliberately:** `picks_by_player_stat` -- what the
site shows beside a box score -- still serves the newest pre-tip row, because
a projection printed next to a game's result has to be the freshest thing the
model said about it, not the first. The record and the display answer two
different questions and are built from two different helpers, each documented
at its own definition.

    single pick would delete the player record rather than deduplicate it.

    the wrong one.

    A rerun of the same player prop on the same game is history: it stays in
    `player_prediction_snapshots` and is not graded. Otherwise re-running the
    models until the numbers looked right would be free.

    Every returned row carries `made_before_tip`, DERIVED from its own
    `created_at` against the game's tip-off as UTC instants and failing closed
    to False, so the caller can publish the headline MAE over every counted row

    without the two disagreeing about which rows are which.

    a handful of a season's ~1,760 scheduled games. So the outcomes are read
