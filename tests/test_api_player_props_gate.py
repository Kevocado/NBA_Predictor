"""The props endpoint: an in-sample MAE on every row, and the gate applied.

/games/{id}/players stays a bare JSON array of PlayerPropOut -- the frontend
client already types it that way (frontend/src/api/client.ts getGamePlayers),
so the out entries get their own endpoint rather than a wrapper this backend
PR cannot add without rewriting the frontend it is not allowed to touch.

Two invariants asserted here:

  * no probability is served anywhere on the row. NBA's model is an
    XGBRegressor returning a raw point total; there is no calibrated
    probability to show, and the phase forbids inventing one. Every row is a
    projection.
  * an out player's row is ABSENT from the ranking, not flagged in place, and
    appears exactly once below it with a source and a date.

#     (NBA#22) builds `outIds` from every row of the out feed and filters the

#     from a backend change no frontend PR had asked for. The out feed is a
#     removal instruction; a doubtful player must never be one.
#
# So: a third feed, /games/{id}/players/doubtful. The frontend attaches the
# note by joining on player_id, which is exact for the same reason the gate is.
