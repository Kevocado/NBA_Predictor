"""The fabricated zero did not reach a model. Pinned, so it stays pinned.

The question this file answers: did data/injuries.py's fabricated 0.0 get
fitted into a shipped model, or served to a user?

Answer, traced at 22dfbc7567b08dcbe7e83c242b956e48f69797a0: no, on both counts.

  * Nothing ever called features/injuries.py::missing_players_value except its
    own test. features/__init__.py is empty (so no package re-export), and no
    module in src/ imports features.injuries. Its fabricated zero could only
    have entered a model through a caller that does not exist.
  * The three TEAM models do carry home_missing_value/away_missing_value as
    features (24 features, verified by loading the committed .pkl), but those
    columns are filled by features/build.py:46-48 with a literal 0.0 for every
    row -- a constant, never from the stub -- and XGBoost never split on them,
    so they carry no fitted signal at all.

What these tests lock in:

  * The team models' missing_value columns are a constant, not the stub's
    fabricated per-player zero.
  * A constant feature XGBoost never split on cannot be a fitted influence, so
    even the (unreachable) stub path could not have moved a prediction through
    it.
  * 0.0 IS indistinguishable from a real measured 0.0 downstream -- a genuine
    design defect, recorded here rather than fixed, because build.py's default
    -zero policy covers five columns and changing it is a separate change.

HISTORICAL NOTE (2026-10-14): The five dead columns (home_power_rating,
away_power_rating, power_rating_diff, home_missing_value, away_missing_value)
were REPLACED by the H feature block (elo_diff_s, home_adj_off_s, away_adj_off_s,
home_adj_def_s, away_adj_def_s, home_pace_roll_s, away_pace_roll_s) in
commit 61d4f86. This PR IS that change. The tests below document the OLD
defect; the new features are live, non-constant, and used by the models.
