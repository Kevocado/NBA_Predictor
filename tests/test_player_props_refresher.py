"""Regression: upcoming player projections must follow the team's CURRENT roster.

Live bug: CHI v TOR showed 2 of 28 predicted players on CHI's side because the
roster estimate was frozen at the last manual ingest (before CHI's preseason
game). Real data types throughout: schedule rows as in the schedule cache, ESPN
box-score rows, trained XGB player models, a real SQLite tracking store.
