"""Every third-party module imported under src/ must be a runtime dependency.

This caught a production outage. `api/explain.py` imports `httpx` at runtime,
but F1 did not declare it at all and NBA listed it only under the `dev` extra,
so `docker build && docker run` produced an image that died on import with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'httpx'`. Both services were rolled back
from the VPS.

The test suite could not see it: httpx arrives in the venv through dev/test
tooling (fastapi's own test client, respx, pytest tooling), so every test passed
and the image was broken. That is the whole point of this test — it reads
pyproject.toml, not the venv, so it asks the question the venv cannot answer.

A distribution can satisfy more than one module name, so there is a small
explicit map. Keep it short and keep it honest: a new import with no entry here
fails the test, which is the intended pressure.

    (the tests need it, and dropping a declared runtime dep is a separate change

    change starts importing httpx at runtime again this fails, and the pyproject

    The irony is not lost: this file exists because an *undeclared* httpx broke
    the image, and it is being updated because an *unneeded* one is now declared.
