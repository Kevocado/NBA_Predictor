"""Season carry-over: a rolling window that spans an offseason is not form.

`add_rolling_four_factors` does `shift(1).rolling(10)` per team across the whole
frame. With three seasons loaded, a team's first game of a season therefore
averages the PREVIOUS season's last ten games -- a sample spanning a six-month
gap, presented to the model with the same confidence as a fresh ten-game sample.

Carry-over regresses those early-season values toward the league mean, with the
weight decaying to zero as current-season games fill the window. The weight is
fitted, never hard-coded.

Four claims, one per test:

  * with no weight, the output is byte-identical to today's;
  * week-1 values are built from prior-season games ONLY (checked by identity,
    not by counting);
  * the carry-over weight reaches zero once the window is full of current-season
    games, so nothing downstream is permanently shrunk;
  * a larger weight pulls the first game of a season further toward the mean.
